I was a contributor on the following Conference paper which was presented at the 2010 International Conference on Green Circuits and Systems in Shanghai. I worked on the LMS, RLS, KLMS, KRLS Algorithms and ran simulations in Matlab.

## Getting started in Matlab
The best way to get start in the area of these algorithms in Natlab is to try some example problems. The below code will help those gettingfamiliar with the Reursive Least Squares Algorithm.

```matlab
% Initialize parameters
lambda = 0.99;   % Forgetting factor
delta = 1000;    % Initial value for covariance matrix
n = 2;           % Number of filter coefficients
P = delta * eye(n); % Covariance matrix
theta = zeros(n, 1); % Initial filter coefficients

% Generate sample data
N = 1000; % Number of samples
X = randn(N, n); % Input data
d = X(:, 1) * 0.5 + X(:, 2) * 1.5 + 0.1 * randn(N, 1); % Desired output

% Recursive Least Squares Algorithm
theta_history = zeros(n, N); % To store the history of theta
for k = 1:N
    x = X(k, :)'; % Input vector at time k
    y = theta' * x; % Filter output
    e = d(k) - y; % Estimation error

    % Update the covariance matrix
    K = P * x / (lambda + x' * P * x);
    P = (P - K * x' * P) / lambda;

    % Update the filter coefficients
    theta = theta + K * e;
    theta_history(:, k) = theta; % Store theta history
end

% Plot the estimated coefficients
figure;
plot(1:N, theta_history(1, :), 'r', 1:N, theta_history(2, :), 'b');
xlabel('Sample');
ylabel('Coefficient Value');
title('Recursive Least Squares Estimation');
legend('Coefficient 1', 'Coefficient 2');
```

Matlab has since implemented a recursiveLS object in their more modern packages. The basic usage  is shown below
```
% Create a System object for online estimation using the recursive least squares algorithm.
obj = recursiveLS(2);
% Load the estimation data, which for this example is a static data set.
load iddata3
input = z3.u;
output = z3.y;
% Create a variable to store u(t-1). This variable is updated at each time step.
oldInput = 0;
% Estimate the parameters and output using step and input-output data, maintaining the current regressor pair in H. Invoke the step function implicitly by calling the obj system object with input arguments.

for i = 1:numel(input)
    H = [input(i) oldInput];
    [theta, EstimatedOutput] = obj(output(i),H);
    estimatedOut(i)= EstimatedOutput;
    theta_est(i,:) = theta;
    oldInput = input(i);
end
% Plot the measured and estimated output data.
numSample = 1:numel(input);
plot(numSample,output,'b',numSample,estimatedOut,'r--');
legend('Measured Output','Estimated Output');

% Plot the parameters.
plot(numSample,theta_est(:,1),numSample,theta_est(:,2))
title('Parameter Estimates for Recursive Least Squares Estimation')
legend("theta1","theta2")
```
The code above is provided in order to started using the algorithms mentioned in this paper.

## Paper Summary

The paper explores advanced methods for predicting wind speed and direction using complex augmented kernel adaptive filters. Wind power, a growing renewable energy source, presents challenges due to its intermittent nature. Accurate predictions are crucial for grid stability and turbine operation.

Traditional adaptive filters like LMS and RLS have limitations in handling nonlinear and complex data. The authors propose using complex augmented kernel methods, which incorporate both real and imaginary parts of wind data, enhancing prediction accuracy and computational efficiency. They test these methods on real wind data sampled in an urban environment, finding that kernel algorithms, particularly augmented complex versions, outperform traditional methods.

The study demonstrates that complex augmented kernel methods provide superior performance and flexibility for wind prediction, essential for integrating wind energy into modern power systems. Further research and simulations are planned to optimize these algorithms and improve renewable energy management.
